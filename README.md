# BetterChunkLoader Sponge

This project is a fork of [BetterChunkLoader-ShadowNode](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/BetterChunkLoader)
Which is a continuation of [BetterChunkLoader](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/BetterChunkLoader) for [SpongeForge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge)

This version of BetterChunkLoader for Sponge is intended to allow server owners to have better control over chunkloading. Often this control cannot be easily obtained through mods that provide ChunkLoaders. This version is NOT compatible with datastores used by original versions of BetterChunkLoader or ShadowNode's BetterChunkLoader.
