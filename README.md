# BetterChunkLoader Sponge

This project is a fork of [BetterChunkLoader-ShadowNode](https://bitbucket.org/shadownode/betterchunkloader)
Which is a continuation of [BetterChunkLoader](https://github.com/KaiKikuchi/BetterChunkLoader) for [SpongeForge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge)

Licence: [MIT](LICENSE.md) Permission to change this license to MIT was given by KaiKikuchi

________________________________________________
There are 2 Meta options for setting default chunk allocations.

"online-chunks" & "alwayson-chunks"

As an example you can set these options with this command for luckperms:
/lp group default meta set online-chunks 10

_______________________________________

This version of BetterChunkLoader for Sponge is intended to allow server owners to have better control over chunkloading. Often this control cannot be easily obtained through mods that provide ChunkLoaders. This version is NOT compatible with datastores used by original versions of BetterChunkLoader or ShadowNode's BetterChunkLoader.

You can transfer playerData ONLY from KasperFranz's BetterChunkLoader fork using /bcl transfer, after configuring the database in the config file.
